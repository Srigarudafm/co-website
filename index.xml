      <description>Gated communities, apartment and condo complexes, and other residential living communities share some of the same common threats. The greatest security threats include property theft and burglary, break-ins, vandalism, assaults and loitering. Alarm systems and electronic gates are sound security measures; however, they do have their limitations.
An effective residential security program should include on-site, professional security guards. The guards at SGFM understand the most pressing threats against a residential community and its residents.</description>

      <description>Parking lots are vulnerable to all sorts of crimes and illegal activity. It is not uncommon to hear stories of employees being robbed when they leave the office late at night, or vehicles being broken into while residents sleep. When people are on your property, you want them to feel safe and secure. Not only is this good for the reputation of your business, it’s good business all around. Security doesn’t start once you enter the front door of your business.</description>
